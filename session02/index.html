<p>BIC For Her Retractable Ball Pen, Medium Point, 1.0 mm, Blue Ink, 2 Count (FHAP21-Blue)<br>
	<p class="subhead">Mamma and I were in the drawing room of the town house she has secured for the Season- I reading a forbidden copy of Mary Wollstonecrafts' <i>"Vindication of the Rights of Women"</i> secreted within a slim volume of poetry, Mamma having a comfortable cose close to the fire with her bosom friend Lady Danbury - when Lady Winters and her daughter were announced, tittering with excitement about the latest scandalous on dit. A new line of pens has been introduced by the BiC company - designed specifically for <i>women.</i> Of course, not being quite reconciled to the path which destiny would have me tread as a Young Lady of Quality, which is to say, marry well and populate some aging aristocrat's nursery, I promptly dispatched my abigail to procure one, under threat of having her ears boxed should she not return with the desired product or be indiscreet with said same.</p>

<p class="subhead">Upon receiving the pen, I locked myself in my bedchamber and pulled out a piece of fine writing paper, and proceeded to write my name. The ink glided gently over the paper; the sensuality of the soft scratching of the ballpoint on the paper's surface made my face grow warm. Suddenly my Abigail returned, to help me into the dress in which I would drive in the Park with Lord Xavier Fitzclement, heir of the Earl of Averny. I quickly stuffed the pen into my reticule and forgot about it.</p>

<p class="subhead"><b><i>Alas!</i></b> As my lord and I were driving in the Park at the most fashionable hour, a rabbit darted across the grass, startling the horses! His lovely phaeton - and us within it - overturned! My beautiful high waisted gown of pale green watered silk with an overlay of Valenciennes lace and my straw chip bonnet were covered in mud. But oh, the horror, for there, shining in all its pink glory upon the dark earth, was <i>the BiC For Her Retractable Ball Pen,</i> that had flown from my reticule - right into the path of Lady Jersey's carriage!!!</p>

<p class="subhead">Well. My reputation is in tatters; I am accounted to be a veritable Bluestocking. Mamma has had a Spasm and will probably continue on with the vapors; our vouchers to Almack's have been revoked. We dare not attend the Rutherfords' rout this evening. I cannot bring myself to care overmuch, although I would have liked to try the waltz. I suppose I shall be firmly put on the shelf and rusticate for this next age.</p>

<p class="subhead">Although, after he delivered me safely home, Lord Xavier's eyes twinkled with mirth as he bent over my hand to take his leave with a brief <i>"Your servant, ma'am,"</i> so maybe he has not taken me entirely in disgust. I suppose I shall just have to wait and see what tomorrow brings. There may yet be some way to redeem my reputation. And at least I have my BiC For Her Retractable Ball Pen!</p>
