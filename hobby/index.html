		<img src="images/baby-4100420_1920.jpg" class="spotart" alt="Mom Holding Baby"/>I love being a mom to my 2 year old son.  He is so much fun and I enjoy coming up with great activities for us to do together!</p>

	<p>In May, I will become a mom again to a new baby boy.  I'm excited to start the newborn phase all over again.  I think my older son will be a wonderful big brother.  My husband and I are a little nervous about splitting our time between 2 children but I'm sure we'll figure it out.</p>
	
	<p>I love design and love using my creative brain but find that it is most rewarding to use that creativity towards being a fun mom.  It's been hard to be together so much during the pandemic but I try to remember that I'm lucky to get to spend a whole year home with my family.  I previously commuted to NYC every day for work and never would have dreamed to get so much time together.  It's definitely hard some days but I really try to stay positive! </p>
